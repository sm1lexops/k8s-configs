# Tuning a Linux system for high network load systems.

* Involves adjusting various kernel parameters and network settings to optimize performance. 

## Here are some common steps and configurations to help you get started:

### 1. Adjust Kernel Parameters

> Edit the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file to apply the following kernel parameter changes. After editing, apply the changes with `sudo sysctl -p`.

* Increase Network Buffers

```sh
# Increase the size of the receive buffer
net.core.rmem_max = 16777216
net.core.rmem_default = 16777216
# Increase the size of the send buffer
net.core.wmem_max = 16777216
net.core.wmem_default = 16777216
```

* Increase the Size of the TCP Read and Write Buffers

```sh
# Increase the TCP receive buffer space
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 87380 16777216

# Increase the TCP send buffer space
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 65536 16777216

#Enable TCP Window Scaling
net.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling = 1
```

* Increase the Number of Incoming Connections

```sh
# Increase the maximum number of connections
net.core.somaxconn = 1024

# Increase the maximum number of backlogged sockets
net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 5000
```

* Reduce the TCP FIN Timeout

```sh
# Reduce the time a connection stays in the FIN-WAIT-2 state
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 30
```

*Enable TCP SYN Cookies

```sh
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
```

* Reduce the Frequency of TCP Keepalive Probes

```sh
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 600
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl = 60
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes = 5
```

### 2. Network Interface Tuning

* Increase the Network Interface Queue Length

You can increase the queue length for your network interface (e.g., eth0). Edit `/etc/network/interfaces` or use the `ethtool` command:

```sh
sudo ethtool -G eth0 rx 4096 tx 4096
### 3. Offloading Features
```

* Offloading certain tasks to the network hardware can reduce CPU load. Use the ethtool command to enable offloading features:

```sh
sudo ethtool -K eth0 gro on
sudo ethtool -K eth0 gso on
sudo ethtool -K eth0 tso on
```

### 4. TCP Tuning

* Enable TCP Fast Open. This reduces the latency for the initial connection handshake:

```sh
echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fastopen
### 5. File Descriptor Limits
```

* Increase the number of file descriptors available to processes. Edit `/etc/security/limits.conf`:

```sh
* soft nofile 100000
* hard nofile 100000
```

* Edit /etc/pam.d/common-session and add:

```sh
session required pam_limits.so
### 6. Apply and Validate Changes
```

* To apply the kernel parameter changes immediately without rebooting, use:

```sh
sudo sysctl -p
```

* Validate the changes by checking the current values:

```sh
sysctl net.core.rmem_max
sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_rmem
# And so on for other parameters
```

### 7. Monitor Network Performance

Use tools like `iftop, nload, netstat, ss, iperf, and tcpdump` to monitor and diagnose network performance.

### 8. High-Performance Network Interfaces

For extremely high-load systems, consider using high-performance network interfaces like those provided by Intel or Mellanox, which offer advanced features and optimizations for handling large amounts of network traffic.

### 9. Load Balancing

For very high-load environments, consider using load balancing techniques to distribute network traffic across multiple servers. Tools like HAProxy, NGINX, or dedicated hardware load balancers can be very effective.

### 10. Regular Maintenance and Updates

Regularly update your system and network drivers to ensure you have the latest performance improvements and security patches.

> By tuning these parameters and monitoring the system's performance, you can significantly improve the network performance of a Linux system under high load. Adjustments should be made carefully, and it's recommended to test changes in a staging environment before applying them to production systems.
